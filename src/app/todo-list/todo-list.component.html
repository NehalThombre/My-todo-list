<!--ul tag that contains all of the to-dos in this list.
  *ngFor="let todo of todos" which means "for each item in my list"
  This is followed by [class.completed]="todo.completed",
   which means "if a particular item has been completed, then assign its value as true."
  another *ngFor statement that iterates over all items in this list and
   assigns them values based on whether they are complete or not: <li *ngFor="let todo of todos" [class.completed]="todo.completed">
     Then there's a span tag inside of each li element called .todo-text,
      which displays text from each individual task: {{todo.text}}
      The code is a simple to-do list with an undo button and a complete button.

    <li *ngFor="let todo of todos" [class.completed]="todo.completed">
